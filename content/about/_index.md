I am currently working as a Junior Software Engineer at Korbyt.

I think that coffee, unsweetened milk tea, lifting, Linux, dynamic window managers, functional programming, and good lights are all cool.

# What I Use

## Software

### Distro - [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)

I switched to Linux in late 2020 as I found that Windows got in my way with its poor Window management and myriad other annoyances.
If memory serves, I used MX Linux, Debian, Artix, and Arch before I settled on what I hope to use for a while, NixOS.

## Hardware

### Laptop

I had an HP Envy x360 13" throughout my undergrad, until it broke in my final semester, at which point I purchased a used 6th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon.
I haven't done any PC gaming in quite a while, so it suits my needs well.
What matters to me in a laptop is support for my USB-C hub, low weight, proper size, and decent manufacturing.

### Desktop Setup

- Dock - Anker 575 
- Monitor - LG 34" 3440x1440 ultrawide (on a monitor arm)
- Lamp - PHIVE LED Desk Lamp
- Keyboard - GMMK Compact
- Mice - Kensington Orbit (daily use), Logitech G305 (gaming, hardly used)
- Headphones - Philips SHP9500, Apple EarPods (3.5mm Headphone Plug)
- Cube timer
- Sticky Notes (useful for daily tasks)
